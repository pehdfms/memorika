# Memorika

Memorika speeds up the process of learning a new language by providing top of 
the line spaced repetition tools dedicated to language learning. Unlike 
similar alternatives, Memorika foregoes the desire to be generic in its spaced 
repetition system in favor of being specialized on languages.

## Principles
- Good Defaults Beat Configuration.
  - We're not trying to compete with Anki or Supermemo in generality, we can't.
  - The average user does not know enough about SRS to beat good defaults.
  - The best users won't have the data we have, by definition, to make major choices.
  - Extensive configuration limits our ability to tailor the SRS experience.
